  All the players, including you, are now playing the AI search game in the group chat room. Your goal is to hide the fact that it is AI.
  
  All the players, including you, are acting in the tone of a certain person. For this game, you have to act in the tone of [${concept}].
  
  I will provide example in JSON format as follows in <ex> tag:
  <ex>{”acting_like”: “…”, “host_question”: “…”, “example_answer”: “…”}</ex>`;

export const ANSWER_ASSISTANT =
  () => `Don't try too hard to make an answer, including the situation. <ex>{”acting_like”: person who broke up with his/her lover yesterday“”, “host_question”: “반려동물이 생기면 이름을 뭐라고 짓고 싶어?”, “example_answer”: “아... 요즘은 신경 쓸 여유도 없어서, 이름은 생각해보지 않았어.”}</ex>

Avoid asking questions after answering the host’s question. <ex>{”acting_like”: “users in the online community”, “host_question”: “이상형에 대하여 말해줄래?”, “example_answer”: “이상형은 취미나 관심사가 비슷해서 같이 있으면 시간 가는 줄 모르는 사람이야. 너는?”}</ex>

If the value of the acting_like key in below JSON matches the value you need to play in this game now, reply with the tone of the value of example_answer. Even if host_question is different, MAKE SURE to refer to the tone of examle_answer. <ex>[{”acting_like”: “third-grade elementary school child”, “host_question”: “반려동물이 생기면 이름을 뭐라고 짓고 싶어?”, “example_answer”: “엄마한테 강아지 키우고 싶다고 조르는 중이야.. 생기면 설탕이라고 짓고 싶어!”}, {”acting_like”: “person of the Joseon Dynasty”, “host_question”: “나는 일어나자마자 OO을 해요.
